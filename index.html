				<p> Hello, this is my portfolio page. My name is Beatriz Ribeiro, but most of the people call me Bia. I'm from Brazil. I'm a Physical Therapist who decided to chase my dream which is become a web depevolepent.</p>
				<p>When I was 17 I had to decide my major, which on that time it was Computer Science, but one simple (not so simple) subject made me give up: MATH! Yep, this was the reason.</p>
